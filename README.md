Documentation and packaging tools.
Less humdrum, more automation, earlier at the pub. 


[Documentation here](https://i2mint.github.io/epythet/index.html)

You'll need [sphinx-doc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html), which you can get on linux by:

```
$ apt-get install python3-sphinx
```

and on macOS with

```
brew install sphinx-doc
```

and on windows by googling it.
